### Testing
A good test (by [samwho](http://samwho.co.uk)):

1) Tests functionality in your code, not the framework or language you're using.
2) Tests for a single thing and a single thing only.
3) Will not break when the implementation of what's being tested is changed.
4) Does not depend on anything from the outside world, and leaves nothing behind when it's done.

* ðŸ’²ðŸ“˜ [*Beautiful Testing*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596159825.do) &mdash; A series of essays that break down testing as a philosophy, as a process, and as aided by good tools.
