# Frequently Asked Questions

## <a name="meme"></a>Why did you delete my meme?

Memes have historically been a controvertial topic in our server. On the one
hand, they can be fun. On the other, they can be hurtful. A non-trivial
fraction of memes shared on our server attempt to get laughs by making fun of a
group of people, language, or technology.

It's difficult to draw the line for what is and isn't allowed. We don't want to
ban humour, but we do want to make sure our server doesn't intimidate people or
lead them to believe that people using a language or technology are stupid for
doing so.

If a moderator deleted or asked you to delete your meme, it is because they
were worried that it might break the inclusive atmosphere we try to maintain.

### But it was just a joke, what gives?

We don't doubt that you meant it in good humour. We don't hate fun. What we
want to avoid is having new members join the server, see a room full of people
making fun of their technology choices, and feeling unwelcome. With a community
of over 10,000 people from many different backgrounds, we have to take extra
care in this area.
